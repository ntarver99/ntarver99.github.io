    <p>When a player signs up as a free agent, she is signing up as an individual and will form a team of fellow free agent sign-ups or guest play on another team looking for members. The free agent will be coached by one of the Hot Sauce Lacrosse coaches, if playing for the House Team.</p>
    <h3>Do you require players to have a USA lacrosse membership?</h3>
